### Recommendations

1. **Inventory Optimization**
   - Reduce slow-moving inventory by $800K through targeted promotions
   - Implement VMI program for top 3 suppliers
   - Target turnover ratio: 4.0x by Q2 2025

2. **Process Improvements**
   - Enhanced demand forecasting system implementation
   - Automated reorder point adjustments
   - Cross-dock operations for fast-moving items

### Action Items

| Priority | Action | Owner | Timeline |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| High | Slow-moving inventory reduction | Operations Dir. | Q1 2025 |
| High | VMI program implementation | Procurement | Q2 2025 |
| Medium | Forecast system upgrade | IT/Operations | Q3 2025 |

### Cash Flow Impact

Working capital improvement potential:
- Inventory reduction target: $800K
- Cash conversion cycle improvement: 8 days
- Projected annual carrying cost savings: $120K

This analysis identifies significant opportunities to optimize inventory management while maintaining service levels. Implementation of recommendations could release $2.1M in working capital over the next two quarters.
