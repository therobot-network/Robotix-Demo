## Risk Assessment
Primary Risks:
1. Component supply chain delays (Mitigation: Multiple supplier agreements)
2. Software integration complexity (Mitigation: Increased testing resources)
3. Certification timeline (Mitigation: Early engagement with certification bodies)

## Current Status
- Mechanical prototype completed and undergoing testing
- Basic motion control software implemented
- Vision system integration at 40% completion
- Initial customer feedback gathered from focus groups
- Supply chain agreements secured for 80% of components

## Next Steps
1. Complete vision system integration (Due: Q2 2024)
2. Initiate beta testing program with three key customers
3. Finalize production tooling design
4. Begin certification process documentation
5. Develop training materials and service documentation

Project tracking indicates current progress aligns with timeline objectives, with resource utilization at expected levels. Weekly status meetings and monthly steering committee reviews continue to maintain project momentum and address emerging challenges.
