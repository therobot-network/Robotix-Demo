   - Critical component stockouts: 3 incidents in Q2

### Recommendations

1. **Inventory Optimization:**
   - Implement min-max levels for top 20 components
   - Reduce safety stock for stable demand items
   - Target: Release $2.1M working capital by Q4

2. **Process Improvements:**
   - Enhanced demand forecasting accuracy
   - Vendor managed inventory for non-critical parts
   - Cross-dock operations for distribution center

### Action Items

1. **Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days):**
   - Clear aged WIP inventory ($220K value)
   - Implement ABC analysis for component ordering
   - Review slow-moving SKUs (>180 days)

2. **Medium Term (60-90 Days):**
   - Deploy inventory optimization software
   - Negotiate vendor lead times
   - Establish KPI dashboard for real-time monitoring

### Working Capital Impact

```
Current Working Capital Tied in Inventory: $7.2M
Target Working Capital (Q4 2024): $5.1M
Potential Release: $2.1M

Cash Conversion Cycle:
- DIO: 109.0 days
- DSO: 45.0 days
- DPO: 60.0 days
Net CCC: 94.0 days
```

### Conclusion

While showing improvement from Q1, our inventory management still requires attention to reach industry benchmarks. Implementation of recommended actions could release significant working capital while maintaining service levels. Key focus areas remain WIP reduction and finished goods optimization.
