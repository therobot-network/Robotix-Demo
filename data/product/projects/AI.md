# RobotiCare AI Platform - Project Documentation
*Project ID: PMD-2024-01*

## Project Overview
Development of a cloud-based predictive maintenance platform leveraging artificial intelligence to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of Robotix industrial robot fleets. The platform will integrate with our existing RX-7000 and RX-8000 series robots, providing real-time diagnostics and predictive maintenance capabilities.

## Core Objectives
- Reduce unplanned downtime by 75% through early fault detection
- Implement predictive maintenance alerts with 92%+ accuracy
- Develop comprehensive fleet analytics dashboard
- Enable over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates and parameter optimization
- Achieve ROI of 3.5x for customers within 18 months

## Technical Architecture
### Data Collection Layer
- Sensor integration: Temperature, vibration, power consumption, torque
- Real-time telemetry streaming via secure gateway
- Edge processing units for preliminary data analysis
- Data sampling rate: 100Hz for critical parameters

### Cloud Infrastructure
