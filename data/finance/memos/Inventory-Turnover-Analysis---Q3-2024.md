## Cash Flow Impact

Working Capital Analysis:
- Inventory carrying cost: $216K/quarter (3% of value)
- Cash conversion cycle: 156 days
- DSO: 45 days
- DPO: 38 days

## Risk Assessment

High-Risk Areas:
1. RX-2000 component obsolescence ($180K exposure)
2. CollabBot sensor inventory (tech upgrade pending)
3. Supply chain concentration in Asian markets

## Recommendations

1. Implement JIT for standard components
   - Potential working capital release: $400K
   - Target implementation: Q4 2024

2. Optimize slow-moving inventory
   - Bundle older models with service contracts
   - Target clearance: $250K by year-end

3. Enhanced demand forecasting
   - Implement ML-based forecasting system
   - Expected accuracy improvement: 15%

## Action Items

Immediate Actions:
1. Review $480K slow-moving inventory for clearance
2. Negotiate VMI agreements with top 3 suppliers
3. Implement cycle counting program in Portland DC
4. Accelerate RX-2000 component consumption

90-Day Objectives:
- Reduce DIO to 95 days
- Increase turnover ratio to 3.8x
- Release $500K working capital
- Implement automated reorder points

## Next Steps

1. Weekly review of slow-moving inventory
2. Monthly cross-functional inventory optimization meetings
3. Quarterly supplier performance reviews
4. Implementation of new inventory management software

This analysis identifies significant opportunities for inventory optimization while maintaining service levels. Key focus areas include reducing slow-moving inventory and implementing more sophisticated demand forecasting tools.
