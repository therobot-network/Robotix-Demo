  - Product (meetings, memos, projects, support tickets)
  - Sales-Marketing (customers, campaigns, leads, memos)
  - Public (product specs, guides, marketing forms)

### 2. File Tree Generator ✅
- Created `generate_file_tree.py` script
- Generates hierarchical JSON structure of all data files
- Includes file metadata (size, extension, path)
- Output: `/website/src/data/file_tree.json`

### 3. Demo Files Page Component ✅

- Added link to footer navigation
- Positioned next to "Customer Portal" button as requested

### 5. Routing ✅

- Imported and configured DemoFiles component

### 6. Automation Scripts ✅
- Created `update_demo_files.sh` script to:
  - Copy data files from `/data` to `/website/public/data`
  - Regenerate file tree JSON
- Added `update-demo-files` npm script to `package.json`

```bash
cd website
npm run update-demo-files
```

## Key Features

### File Browser

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- React + TypeScript
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Lucide React (icons)
- React Router (routing)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Python 3 (file tree generation)

### Performance
- File tree pre-generated at build time
- Lazy loading of file contents on demand
- Efficient tree filtering with memoization
- Optimized animations for 60fps

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive
- Touch-friendly interactions

## Important Notes

### Privacy & Security ⚠️

All files in `/website/public/data` are publicly accessible. Ensure:

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Syntax highlighting for code files
2. CSV table viewer
3. JSON tree viewer
4. Markdown rendering
5. File preview thumbnails
6. Bulk download (zip)
7. File metadata sorting
8. Recent files list
9. Favorites/bookmarks
10. Access logging

## Maintenance

### Adding New Data Files
1. Add files to `/data` directory
2. Run `npm run update-demo-files`
