## 🚨 Critical Findings - RESOLVED

### 1. HR Documents (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Status:** ❌ EXPOSED → ✅ REMOVED

**Documents Found:**
- `employee-handbook-2024.html` - Employee policies and procedures
- `benefits-overview-2024.html` - Compensation and benefits information
- `remote-work-policy.html` - Internal work policies

**Risk Level:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**  
**Exposure:** These documents were publicly accessible via:
- `/website/public/html_documents/hr/` (served to web)
- `/website/dist/html_documents/hr/` (built distribution)
- Listed in `/website/src/data/documents.json` (frontend display)

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Removed all HR documents from `/website/public/html_documents/hr/`
- ✅ Removed all HR documents from `/website/dist/html_documents/hr/`
- ✅ Removed HR category and entries from frontend `documents.json`
- ✅ Updated `Documentation.tsx` to remove HR category from UI
- ✅ Source data preserved in `/data/html_documents/hr/` (not web-accessible)

### 2. Legal/Compliance Documents (MEDIUM - FIXED)
**Status:** ⚠️ EXPOSED → ✅ REMOVED FROM DOCUMENTATION

**Documents Found:**
- `privacy-policy.html` - Company privacy policy
- `warranty-and-return-policy.html` - Product warranty terms

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**  
**Note:** While these are typically public documents, they were incorrectly placed in the documentation section rather than as proper footer/legal pages.

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Removed from `/website/public/html_documents/legal/`
- ✅ Removed from `/website/dist/html_documents/legal/`
- ✅ Removed Legal category from frontend documentation
- ✅ Source data preserved in `/data/html_documents/legal/`

**Recommendation:** These should be reimplemented as dedicated legal pages with proper routing (e.g., `/legal/privacy-policy`) if needed for public access.

**Documents Found in Metadata:**

**Risk Level:** 🔴 **CRITICAL IF EXPOSED**  
**Current State:** 
- ❌ Listed in `documents.json` metadata
- ✅ **NOT** in public folder (files exist only in `/data/`)
- ❌ Would have been exposed if files were copied to public

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Removed all financial entries from `documents.json`
- ✅ Files remain safely in `/data/html_documents/financial/` (not web-accessible)
- ✅ Financial category removed from frontend

---

**Documents Listed (but files missing):**
- `product-satisfaction-survey.html`
- `customer-service-experience-survey.html`
- `post-purchase-feedback-form.html`

**Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW**  
**Finding:** These were listed in `documents.json` but actual HTML files don't exist anywhere.

**Actions Taken:**
